# Question

Create a shell program that duplicates a directory along with its files. Set the file owner's permissions to read, write, and execute, grant group members permission to read and write, and allow others to read only. Afterwards, save all the information (file name, file permissions, size, and file creation date) of subdirectories within a directory to a file located in the corresponding directory.

Certainly! I've reformatted the explanation to fit the Markdown format, and I've incorporated the suggestions you provided. Here's the README.md content:

# Directory Copy and Permission Script

This script allows users to duplicate a directory while specifying custom file permissions for the copied files and directories. It also provides a brief explanation of the script and considerations for its use.

## Usage

1. **Reading Input**: The script uses the `read` command to read user input. The user is expected to provide two values separated by a space: `foldername` (the source directory) and `duplicate` (the destination directory).

2. **Copying a Directory**: The script copies the contents of the source directory (`foldername`) to the destination directory (`duplicate`) using the `cp` command. The `-r` flag indicates a recursive copy, copying all subdirectories and files within the source directory.

3. **Setting File Permissions**: The script sets specific file permissions for the destination directory (`duplicate`) and its contents using the `chmod` command:
   - Owner (user): Read, write, and execute permissions (7).
   - Group members: Read and write permissions (6).
   - Others: Read-only permission (4).

## Considerations

Please be aware of the following points when using this script:

- The script does not check for the existence of the source directory or handle errors that may occur during the copy operation.
- It might not handle directory or file names with spaces correctly due to the lack of proper quoting.
- The permissions set in `chmod` are relatively permissive, especially for group members. Consider adjusting these permissions based on your specific use case and security requirements.

It's recommended to include error handling and validation in your scripts, especially when dealing with user input and file operations.

## Example Usage

1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   bash shell.sh
   ```

2. Enter the source directory name and the destination directory name when prompted.

3. The script will copy the contents of the source directory to the destination directory and set the specified file permissions.
