# Introduction to ls command in UNIX

The `ls` command in UNIX is used to list files and directories in a directory. It provides information about the names, permissions, ownership, and other attributes of the listed files and directories. This C program demonstrates the functionality of the `ls` command by listing all the files and directories in the current directory.

## Algorithm of the Program

1. Open the current directory using `opendir(".")` function.
2. If the directory cannot be opened, display an error message and exit.
3. Use a loop to read each directory entry using the `readdir()` function.
4. Print the name of each entry using `printf()`.
5. Close the directory using the `closedir()` function.
6. Exit the program.

## Explanation of the Program

The program begins by including necessary header files:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <dirent.h>
```

- `stdio.h` is included for standard input/output operations.
- `stdlib.h` is included for the `exit()` function to handle error conditions.
- `dirent.h` is included for directory handling functions and structures.

Next, the main function is defined:

```c
int main() {
    // Code goes here
    return 0;
}
```

Inside the main function:

1. A pointer to `struct dirent` and a pointer to `DIR` are declared:

   ```c
   struct dirent *dir;
   DIR *directory = opendir(".");
   ```

   The `opendir()` function opens the current directory, represented by `"."`. If the directory cannot be opened, it returns `NULL`.

2. If the directory is `NULL`, it means the current directory cannot be opened. In that case, an error message is displayed, and the program exits using `exit(1)`:

   ```c
   if (directory == NULL) {
       printf("Unable to open the current directory.\n");
       exit(1);
   }
   ```

3. The program enters a loop to read each directory entry:

   ```c
   while ((dir = readdir(directory)) != NULL) {
       // Code goes here
   }
   ```

   The `readdir()` function reads the next directory entry and returns a pointer to `struct dirent`. The loop continues until `readdir()` returns `NULL`, indicating the end of directory entries.

4. Inside the loop, the name of each entry is printed using `printf()`:

   ```c
   printf("%s\n", dir->d_name);
   ```

   The `d_name` member of `struct dirent` stores the name of the directory entry.

5. After the loop, the directory is closed using `closedir(directory)`:

   ```c
   closedir(directory);
   ```

   The `closedir()` function frees the resources associated with the directory.

6. Finally, the program returns 0 to indicate successful execution:

   ```c
   return 0;
   ```

### Why dirent.h is Used

The `dirent.h` header file provides the necessary functions and structures for working with directories. It defines the `DIR` structure for representing a directory stream and the `struct dirent` structure for storing information about each directory entry. The functions like `opendir()`, `readdir()`, and `closedir()` are used to open, read, and close directories, respectively.

The `dirent.h` header file is included in this program to utilize these directory handling functions and structures and perform the listing of files and directories in the current directory.
